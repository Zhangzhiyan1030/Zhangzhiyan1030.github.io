1. After insulting someone on Weibo, the post garnered thousands of reposts and likes, resulting in a six-month account suspension.
2. Posting pictures or videos of my cat on Xiaohongshu—whether through photos, videos, or drawings—has gotten lots of likes, and it warms my heart.
3. Back in middle school, posting pretentious literary comments on NetEase Cloud Music. Thought I was so cool back then, but now I want to strangle my past self. All comments have been deleted (2016).
4. Nothing else to add. Wow, you're amazing, teacher—how did you manage to publish so much? I couldn't even come up with six points myself.
