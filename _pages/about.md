Hello, I'm Zhiyan Zhang. You can call me Cecilia. This is my first time using GitHub, and my first time programming. Over the past day, I've had countless urges to drop the class, binge eat, and smash my computer. I've cried to countless friends who learn computer about why I'm learning programming when I major in New Media, begging they teach me how to fix this website. Unfortunately, they all coincidentally had things to do—my friends are highly accomplished in gaming, dating, and traveling. Then, at 2 a.m., I refreshed the screen and saw the teacher's avatar replaced by this yellow bunny on the right. That's when I knew I probably wouldn't drop the class after all... You can call it Usachi. From now on, it is me, and I am it. Not much else to say. I'm satisfied with myself right now. No need to worry about my mental state either—who in journalism studies doesn't go a little mad? If teachers can admire Socrates, why can't I adore Usachi? Go for it! All the world's hardships can knock me down! You can find [CV](cv/) here. I haven't updated it yet. If you click on it now, you'll only see the teacher's CV.
