## Anime and Manga

I prefer Japanese anime, but I also enjoy Chinese, Korean, and American comics. But I only watch anime on Bilibili, so I can only post Bilibili links here. Please bear with me.

- [Crayon Shin-chan](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep825757?spm_id_from=333.1387.0.0&from_spmid=666.25.episode.0)  I've watched it since I was a kid. 
- Is there really anyone who doesn't like watching [EVA](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep29857?spm_id_from=333.1387.0.0&from_spmid=666.25.episode.0)?
- It's precisely because I like [Shikimura Nanao](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep90830?spm_id_from=333.1387.0.0&from_spmid=666.25.episode.0) that I like pink-haired girls.
- Who are you? Please support [Danganronpa](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ss4400?spm_id_from=333.1387.0.0)!

{{% callout note %}} I've been hooked on [Luo Xiaohei Chronicles](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ss1733?spm_id_from=333.1387.0.0) lately. Check it out! {{% /callout %}}

- Luo Xiaohui Chronicles [Season 1](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep32374?spm_id_from=333.1387.0.0&from_spmid=666.25.episode.0) (Episodes 1-20)
- Luo Xiaohui Chronicles [Season 2](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep82320?spm_id_from=333.1387.0.0&from_spmid=666.25.episode.0) (Episodes 21-40)


## The books I prefer

I am planning to teach a undergraduate course based on Professor Liu Junqiang's book titled The Craft of Writing (《写作是门手艺》). [Github Repo](https://github.com/SocratesAcademy/craft). 
- Here is the [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SocratesAcademy/craft/blob/main/The-Craft-of-Writing.ipynb?flush_cache=true) and [Slides](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/SocratesAcademy/craft/blob/main/The-Craft-of-Writing.ipynb#/). 
- I find the Essay Writing Guide written by Jordan B Peterson is very useful. I convert it into slides and add some annotations. [The Power of Writing: Ten Steps of Essay Writing](https://computational-communication.com/workshop/notebook/Essay%20Writing%20Guide.slides.html#/). 
- In addition, I highly recommend Howard Becker's book **Writing for Social Scientists** ([Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/SocratesAcademy/tricks/blob/main/Writing4SocialScientists.ipynb) & [Slides](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/SocratesAcademy/tricks/blob/main/Writing4SocialScientists.ipynb#/)). 
- Similarly, I like Anthony Miles's introduction to [A Taxonomy of Research Gaps](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/SocratesAcademy/craft/blob/main/WritingResearchGaps.ipynb#/).
- Yet my favorite book on academic writing is Paul J. Silva's **How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing** ([Slides](https://socratesacademy.github.io/craft/how-to-write-a-lot-2023.slides.html#/)). 

## Currently interest

I've recently become completely hooked on bead art, assembling countless tiny beads into intricate patterns. It might seem a bit childish for kindergarteners, but it's just right for graduate students.

and I think it is very useful as the textbook for the class of Causal Inference 101. Check the
[Slides](https://nbviewer.org/format/slides/github/socrateslab/causal101/blob/main/causal101.ipynb#/) and [Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/socrateslab/causal101/blob/main/causal101.ipynb). 
- I am co-organizing the Causal Inference 101 course with [Dr. Zhihao Ma](https://github.com/xiaoma093), check the [github repo](https://github.com/socrateslab/causal101/discussions) of **Causal Inference 101**.
- I highly recommend the book titled [**Causal Inference for The Brave and True**](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html).


## Let me introduce my cat


This is my dearest cat. You can call it Meow. You can be delighted to see it's a tabby cat.

If you're going to keep a cat, you need to be prepared to wrestle with it. That means you must have a strong body, a resilient spirit, and an unyielding character. So get to work, kid—get to work.

But if you're looking for some free cat-petting opportunities, head over to the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University. It's home to the most beautiful cats on the entire Nanjing University campus. You're sure to have a great time. And don't forget to bring some cat treats or freeze-dried snacks!
